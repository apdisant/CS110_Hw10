Game of war featuring GUI implementation.

For the grader:
the main war game function is War.java it extends HalfStacks.java
the console implementation is in warTester.java
the GUI implementation is in WarGUI.java
classes DeckDriver, firstGui, halfStacksTest and testDeck are made by me to test functionality
all other java files are from blackboard or useless.
for the javadocs my compiler made a ton of files, but from index html you can see all of the ones that matter.
